h1. YUI 2in3 Project

This project contains the all of the supported versions of YUI 2 wrapped
as first class YUI 3 modules, and deployed in a directory structure that
can be intrinsically loaded by YUI 3.1.0+.

h2. Serving the 2in3 files from your local server

Copy all of the files in the dist directory to the location
you wish to serve the files from.  Configure your YUI instance
to pull from that location:

<pre class="console">
YUI({
    groups: {
        yui2: {
            base: '/2in3/',

            // If you have a combo service, you can configure that as well
            // combine: true,
            // comboBase: 'http://myserver.com/combo?',
            // root: '/2in3/build/',

            patterns:  { 
                'yui2-': {
                    configFn: function(me) {
                        if(/-skin|reset|fonts|grids|base/.test(me.name)) {
                            me.type = 'css';
                            me.path = me.path.replace(/\.js/, '.css');
                            me.path = me.path.replace(/\/yui2-skin/, '/assets/skins/sam/yui2-skin');
                        }
                    }
                } 
            }
        }
    }
}).use('yui2-yahoo', 'yui2-event', function (Y) {
    //
};
</pre>

h2. Additional Notes

* YUI 3 will try to pull the 2.8.0 version of YUI 2 by default.
  The 'yui2' config can be passed to the instance to load one
  of the other versions.
* The public release of 2.8.0 is called 2.8.0r4 because of deployment
  issues at the time it was released.  Accepting the default YUI 2
  option for 2.8.0 will in fact be pulling the same content that is
  in the 2.8.0r4 release.
